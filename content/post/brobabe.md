Writing this in class today, I am sort of busy nowadays or at least I feel like I am pretending to be busy. I need to get back my stuff together however. Yesterday I had to edit a video but my computer basically started burning and then my render didn't translate well into export and that was really annoying. Ended up using another machine and it took just ten minutes to render and export the video so that was nice. The people for whom I was making it liked it. Yesterday was the hottest day of the week but then there were thunderstorms in the night. No rain but the wind was so strong that I felt like I would hve literally blown : )). I am sticking to general schedule quite well, waking up and sleeping at correct time, eating food correctly, yada yada but everything else is getting out of hand or at least I feel like that so over the weekend I will try to fix that. 
No other updates right now, will come back later. bibi.
