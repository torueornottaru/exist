One of my favorite games of all time is the Ace Attorey series. It has this essence of childhood naivety in it while also dealig with some mature and macabre themes in a realistic way. I think I would've liked playing this game as a kid but I don't believe I would have understood the subtextual themes as a kid and would've just treated it as a puzzle solving game or as a story book--it is quite funny that the game is considered to be a visual novel when one of the primary mechanics of the game is blowing i the mic to get fingerprints. Of the various games in my series, my favorite would be Justice for All. Primarily because of one of the key topics in the final chapter. I won't be spoiling the game in case future me forets about it but that key topic is codependecy. The proper definition for codependency is still debated upon but if you have ever come across it, you will understand how well Ace Attorney conveys it. There were various phases that I went through myself while trying to comprehend such a heavy term. There have been people in my life who have told me to my face that they are addicted to me, who have written me letters professing love after years of no contact, or emails talking about how they were in a better mental state when I was with them on long forgotten accounts that my father ends up finding about : ), some who still stalk me. I never liked any writings by Dazai or Kafka. There is no doubt that their writing is objectively exceptional, and it is completely understandable to talk about your mistakes and failures and how they define you. But to me, subjectively, the writing felt more like verse five of psalm one twenty--that these failures were the only thing that defined them. The absence of growth just made entire pieces feel completely disingenuous to me. 


"Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies

How honorable ladies sought my love,

Which I denying, they fell sick and died—

I could not do withal!—then I’ll repent,

And wish, for all that, that I had not killed them.

And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell."

My first thought towards these relationships had a sense of deniability to them, that it just happened to be my luck that I came across such people. These thoughts carried a similar sense of disgust as what I feel about the authors mentioned above. There's no denying that I am a really stupid person. I don't do well in loud crowds, I often struggle with understanding basic concepts, I try my hardest to understand social cues but I always end up falling face first. This is also part of the reason why I am usure about getting myself diagnosed. It is not that I will always just see that diagnosis as an excuse: presently, without a diagnosis, there could be a chance that I could still improve, that I could no longer be dumb, but no medication would make me better at understanding what people mean if I end up getting diagnosed. Grief is not linear and the sheer concept of it having various stages never stood right with me. After failing to make it work, my next phase was not anger, just deniability i another form. That I enabled these people because of my own stupidity. Eventually, I got out. For me, the key to acceptance was to stop trying to make it make sense; it was my fault and I had to move on. Back when I was in school, I used to walk for hours in monsoon until I ended up contracting pneumonia. The rain would be the only noise I could hear in those moments. Its echos would fill the hollows in my brain where I would sometimes stay for hours just thinking. Closest I have ever come to that feeling again is in a crowded train. Clearly, I used to feel like a puppet: if my father would have decided on a diffeent job, I'd be living a different life in South Africa, my identities, my memories, my ideals, my morals. To be fair, it is true that external circumstances do shape personalities but I have since realized that they are a very minor concept. I am on a crossroad, 10 hours from now, I have to make a decision. One would involve self sacrfice so that my friends' lives remain unchanged and the other being the opposite. It is funny to me that I have already chosen which path I am taking and as far back as I can recall to the time when I was 4, I took the same path back then. The external circumstances have definitely shaped me, but my decisions also tell me that some parts of my identities will never change. I made mistakes, it was my fault but that specific neuron somewhere dictates tha I have to move onwards in a specific direction.
