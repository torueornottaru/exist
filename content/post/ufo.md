- The site went down for a bit which is why I couldn't upload for some time. 

- I was lying down on a roof last night looking up at the stars, I ended up sleeping for a while. I rarely remember my dreams but I know that I am getting more nightmares nowadays because I wake up at odd hours breathing heavily.
