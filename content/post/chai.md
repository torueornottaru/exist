The world is ending in 30 minutes. Everyone has known it for a few months now. I am done saying whatever words I can give with a certain sense of finality to people around me. But now, I have only 30 minutes left. What do I do in this time. You would think that according to general science-fiction apocalyptic rules, the world would have descended into anarchy. Burning, looting, rapes: but that is nothing more than the white man's fantasy. You'd only do those things if you believe you could live another day. But there's no living after the next 30 minutes. There's no such thing as existence. For once in the entirety of consciousness, there's a collective belief in just giving up. It is the logical thing to do at this point. There's nothing else that's relevant, especially ater the next 30 minutes. My parents would be calling me non-stop at this point. They have consistently informed us that that there's nothing else significant in their lives apart from their kids. Would I be picking up their calls? I am sure that even if I informed them that I don't wish to talk to them in the final moments, they would still maybe try to contact me. It all depends on how they feel. My sister might call me for a few moments but she is her own person. Hopefully all of this is over before the last 30 minutes. I don't think anyone else will tall to me. I don't have any friends. Maybe someone will text me: asking me how I am doing, confessing old regrets, sharing their deepest secrets. Would I respond? I am always scared that I am pushing people away, but I am not. I don't know what I am doing. 

I'll start by making tea. I'll get ginger and milk. I already have sugar, tea leaves and cardamoms. I'll go sit on that swing in the middle of the forest. Hopefully everyone else would have left college by this point to be around their loved ones. I'll look at the moon, count the number of stars, see how high I can go with the swing. Nothing ever mattered. All of the memories, they are all futile. There's no reason for me to remember anything but I do. I remember everything. They create these invisible scars, unnoticeable even to me. I am nothing more than a puppet with infinite strings attached around my neck like a noose. It's as if I am made out of clay, molded into something barely recognizable. My eyes are gouged out, I know you are reading this, my face is disfigured, my voice no longer one I can recognize, my hands and legs bent at inhumane angles. Strings everywhere, controlling my every move, shaping my identity. I will always remember. When it will be close to midnight, I'll come back to the kitchen and wash my dishes while the world ends around me. I hope I'll be at peace.
