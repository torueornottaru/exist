I used to look out of the window of my classroom of first grade whenever I was bored. It was either this or try to hear sounds from the table when keeping my head down. However the class used to be really loud half of the time so the only way to get a sense of peace was by looking out. Tall trees swaying in the distance and a severe lack of clouds due to summer. In just a few months, the playground below would get flooded because of poor drainage. There used to be older kids playing over there most of the time since they could bully anyone else who tried to take 'their' space. At least, that's what I thought they would do, I never talked to any of them. 
When I was bored with nothing to do at home, I'd open my mother's phone and play with its calendar and calculator (father's phone was off limits due to office work). It was fun to sift through the months and realize how old I will be at those times. 

Don't know why it is so hard to write for me, will come back later.
